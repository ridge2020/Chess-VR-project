Chess is a very popular game across many cultures. However, if you want to play in non-physical mediums, 
you are limited to simplified virtual games that often lack the true experience of chess. Our team  developed 
chess as a VR (Virtual Reality) experience. It provides ample room and options for playing chess without the 
burden of playing in the real world. Our game is built on the Unity engine, and developed for both the Oculus 
and HTC Vive headsets. The game uses a combination of collision detection and physics designed for VR to simulate 
physical interaction with the game pieces. Players have access to resources for study and challenges. There are 
also different levels of AI (Artificial Intelligence) opponents reflecting different methods of play: beginner 
AI randomly chooses legal moves without much strategy, while more advanced AI puts different weights on 
different moves in order to try and make the most beneficial moves available. Players will also have the 
option to play against real people in realtime in a multiplayer game mode, allowing them to play chess as if in real life.
